# Finetune LLMs
> Check also the transformer documentation on Hugging face

> See a video where they show you how to use a transform from Hugging face

# Open-source LLMs
- LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) 3
- GPT-Neo and GPT-J developed by EleutherAI
- Mistral

# Fine-tuning Large Language Models [1]
- Fine-tune an exisiting LLM for a specific case
- A smaller (fine-tuned) model can outperform a larger base model

## 3 ways to fine-tune
1. Self-supervised
2. Supervised
3. Reinforcement Learning
