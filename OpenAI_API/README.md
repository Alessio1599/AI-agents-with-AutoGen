# OpenAI API
> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is commonly used to format data in various applications, including responses from language models (LLMs)

Issues:
- Take token limits into account
  - OpenAI GPT 3.5 turbo has a token limit of about 16k tokens
  - GPT4 has a limit of 8k tokens -> 100k
    - this limit is input+output tokens

- We can define a function to compute the number of tokens
